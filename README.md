<p align="center">***Welcome to the repository containing the work I completed during my five-month internship at OSU-Réunion, under the supervision of UMR Espace-Dev.***</p>

During this internship, my main task was to implement and evaluate the automatic shoreline detection at the scale of Reunion Island using the [**Shoreline Analysis and Extraction Tool**](https://github.com/jpalomav/SAET_master) (SAET).

This tool is being used for the first time in this context at Reunion Island to extract time series of shoreline positions from satellite imagery. My work focused on adapting and validating the method to the complex geomorphological settings of the island’s coastline.

The internship was funded by CNRS, providing a monthly stipend of 659 euros, for a workload of 35 hours per week at ([**OSU-Reunion**](https://www.osureunion.fr/)).

SAET is accessible via GitHub and requires a specific installation process involving Bash or CMD commands and the creation of virtual environments, as detailed in this repository.

The core research question addressed during this internship was:
How to validate the time series of shoreline positions automatically extracted by SAET to ensure the reliability and usefulness of this data for analyzing coastal dynamics through satellite remote sensing?

To support this validation, I also applied the [**Dynamic Shoreline Analysis System**]([https://github.com/jpalomav/SAET_master](https://www.usgs.gov/software/digital-shoreline-analysis-system-version-6)) (DSAS) to precisely analyze spatial and temporal shoreline changes. 

Summary of the work carried out:

    Processing a time series of Sentinel-2 images spanning 2015-2025.

    Extraction and fine calibration of shoreline positions using [**SAET**](https://github.com/jpalomav/SAET_master), tailored to local morphological specificities.

    Spatial validation with high-resolution orthophotos and Pléiades imagery, integrating tidal and wave data.

    Multi-scale analysis of coastal dynamics, highlighting impacts of extreme events such as Cyclone Garance (2025).

    Identification of method limitations and proposals for future improvements, especially in complex sedimentary contexts.

    Prospects for operational, continuous monitoring transferable to other island coastal zones.

This repository provides access to all documents, codes, and data related to this internship project—a first significant scientific contribution intended to support further research and applications.

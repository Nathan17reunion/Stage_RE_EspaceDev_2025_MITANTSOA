<p align="center">***Welcome to the repository containing the work I completed during my five-month internship at OSU-Réunion, under the supervision of UMR Espace-Dev.***</p>

During this internship, my primary responsibility was to implement and evaluate an automatic shoreline detection method at the scale of Réunion Island using the open-source [**Shoreline Analysis and Extraction Tool**](https://github.com/jpalomav/SAET_master) (SAET). This project marks the first application of SAET in this specific geomorphological context, aiming to extract time series of shoreline positions from satellite imagery and adapt the methodology to the island’s complex coastal environments.

The internship was funded by CNRS, providing a monthly stipend of 659 euros for a 35-hour work week at [**OSU-Reunion**](https://www.osureunion.fr/).

[**SAET**](https://github.com/jpalomav/SAET_master) is available on GitHub and involves a dedicated setup process using Bash or CMD commands and virtual environment configuration, all detailed in this repository.

The central research question guiding this work was: **How can we validate the automatically extracted time series of shoreline positions from [**SAET**](https://github.com/jpalomav/SAET_master) to ensure data reliability and its practical use for analyzing coastal dynamics via satellite remote sensing ?**

To complement this validation, I employed the [**Dynamic Shoreline Analysis System**](https://www.usgs.gov/software/digital-shoreline-analysis-system-version-6) (DSAS), which enables precise spatial and temporal quantification of shoreline changes. 

Summary of the work carried out:

    Processing a comprehensive time series of Sentinel-2 satellite images spanning 2015 to 2025.

    Extraction and fine calibration of shoreline positions using the [**Shoreline Analysis and Extraction Tool**](https://github.com/jpalomav/SAET_master) (SAET), specifically adapted to the island’s complex morphological features.

    Spatial validation of results through comparison with high-resolution orthophotos and Pléiades imagery, incorporating tidal and wave data for enhanced accuracy.

    Multi-scale analysis of coastal dynamics over the decade, emphasizing the impact of extreme events such as Cyclone Garance (2025/02/28).

    Identification of methodological limitations and recommendations for future enhancements, particularly in challenging sedimentary environments.

    Prospects for operational and continuous shoreline monitoring workflows, readily transferable to other island coastal systems.

Please note that this is not an official publication, as the project ownership remains with the research institution. My role during the internship was to analyze the data and present findings, which may occasionally diverge from previous works—this is the nature of scientific research, where new questions and challenges often emerge from unexpected results. The materials shared here reflect this exploratory research process and are open for scrutiny, discussion, and further investigation. Your interest, feedback, and collaboration are warmly welcomed to advance our collective understanding.

Feel free to explore the contents, review the results, and follow the methodology to gain a deeper understanding of this work.

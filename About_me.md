🎓 **Graduate student at the University of Reunion**, currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Natural Resources and Natural Hazards in Tropical Environments, with a specialization in [**Geomatics and Remote Sensing**](https://georezo.net/wiki/formation/master_teledetect).

<p align="center">🌍 As part of the **ERASMUS+** exchange program, I have the opportunity to study between Madagascar and La Réunion, which greatly enriches my academic and intercultural experience.</p>

🎓 I am originally from Madagascar and currently a second-year Master’s student in Earth Physics, specializing in [**Geophysics, Environment, and Remote Sensing**](http://ioga.univ-antananarivo.mg/) at the Institute and Observatory of Geophysics of Antananarivo – University of Antananarivo.

🌍 I am currently undertaking a 5-month internship at the Observatory of the Sciences of the Universe of La Réunion ([**OSU-R**](https://www.osureunion.fr/)), from March 24 to August 24, 2025.
My project involves detecting the coastline of La Réunion using a time series of Sentinel-2 satellite images.
The final presentation will take place on June 18, 2025, in the OSU-Réunion conference room.

💻 At the beginning of my studies, I was not very comfortable with programming. However, I have already contributed to a Python-based project studying the seismotectonics of the East African Rift System, collaborating on preliminary measurements using seismic data from the [**USGS**](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/) catalog and the [**Harvard CMT**](https://www.globalcmt.org/).

<p align="center">🚀 Today, I am fully engaged in a large-scale project.
Although I sometimes felt uncertain due to the complexity of the tasks, I have demonstrated autonomy and perseverance.
I would like to thank all the mentors who supported me throughout this work.
I have also acquired new skills, including website development 🌐 and scientific writing with LaTeX 📄.
These experiences have strengthened my motivation and self-confidence despite initial doubts.</p>

<p align="center">📚 My greatest current challenge is learning the English language.
When I was in Madagascar, I had limited resources to improve my English.
Even in public middle and high schools, the time devoted to teaching English, as well as French, is very limited.
Nevertheless, I am confident that I will succeed in progressing thanks to my adaptability and autonomy.</p>

<p align="center">🎯 This ERASMUS program marks the beginning of my career, and I do not let obstacles or difficulties stop me.
I am determined to achieve my goals: successfully complete my academic training 🎓 and seize professional opportunities that will allow me to fully showcase my skills.</p>

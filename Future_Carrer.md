## Curriculum Vitae

To pursue my academic journey, I have been admitted to a work-study (apprenticeship) program for the Master 2 “Risks and Environment” at the University of Reunion.
This next step represents a real opportunity to deepen my specialization in the field that inspires me most: natural hazards.

My ambition is to gain advanced expertise in risk analysis and environmental management, building practical skills directly relevant to the challenges faced by our territories. Through this professional training, I aim to prepare myself for a career path that brings concrete solutions and impact, beyond purely academic research.

By combining rigorous academic learning with hands-on professional experience, I am determined to become an active contributor to risk prevention and the sustainable management of our environment.
This transition is a key milestone in my personal and professional development, reflecting my motivation to grow, take on new responsibilities, and make a difference in the real world.
